            <h1 class="Review1">Shallow River by H.D. Carlton </h1>
            <h3 class="Review1">Review by Effie (Ratings: 4/5)</h3>
            <h4 class="Review1">It’s Dark. It’s twisted. It’s an emotional wreck. It’s full of triggers that will leave you restless. It’s a must must read . I’m absolutely blown away by the brilliance of this read. It had me hooked from get go. Yes it’s her first debut
                as an author and their was some repetitiveness but the story will swallow you whole and spit you out dazed and overwhelmed. There are trigger points of abuse and rape. Nothing is a fairytale in this story. The characters River, Ryan and
                Mako are just a huge wrecking ball that will send you wanting to throw your kindle a lot of times. Just read it, if you dare ! And no it’s not for the faint hearted.

            <h1>Think Like A Designer, Don't Act Like One by Jeroen Van Erp</h1>
            <h3>Review by Kool Kidz (Ratings: 2/5)</h3>
            <h4>A set of short, quick hits on design concepts and maxims. Maybe it was a translation issue, but most of the lessons were so short as to seem superficial or way too general to be useful. For example, "Advanced, yet Acceptable" reads in total:
                "This was the design philosophy of famous American designer Raymond Loewy, best known for his 'streamlined' products in the 1950s - everything from cars to refrigerators. In everyone of his designs he sought to strike just the right balance
                between the familiar and the unknown, because he was convinced that was what consumers would most appreciate. More than 40 years later, research at Delft University of Technology into public acceptance of new products would prove him right.
                And so make his personal philosophy a universal design practice." This is interesting, but for this to be useful, you need a LOT more information. What is the right balance? Is that balance always the same at all times and for all products
                and for all people? What places are the best place to push that balance? Is this only true for products, or does it also work for services? Values? Art? Political ideas? For these design ideas to be at all useful, we need a lot more than
                what is presented here.

            <h1>The House in the Cerulean Sea by T.J. Klune</h1>
            <h3>Review by Heather K (Ratings: 5/5)</h3>
            <h4>This was my first T.J. Klune book but it won't be my last. (And that's a guarantee because I'm currently reading The Extraordinaries. In this whimsical fantasy, a 40-year-old career case worker has his life turned upside down by a special
                assignment. Linus Baker’s job is to ensure the children are safe—or at least he’s convinced himself that the field visits he makes to the orphanages sanctioned by The Department of Magical Youth are crucial to the well-being of these unusual
                children. But everything changes for Linus when Extremely Upper Management sends him to report on an island orphanage that’s a place of last resort for magical children viewed as misfits by the establishment, as well as their unconventional
                caretaker. Linus may have always been a company man, but this visit forces him to question everything he thought he knew about the world—and himself.
